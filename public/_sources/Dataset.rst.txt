Dataset
=======

The dataset component is one of the foundamental components of ``DARF``.
Datasets can be loaded, manipulated, saved and given as an input to a plot function.

Following there are the different documentation sections that explain all this components
and the different possibilities given to the user.

Loading dataset
---------------

A dataset can be loaded in different ways:

* Locally, when a file is available
* Remotly, when an ssh connection to a server can be opened to retrieve the ``.csv`` file
* As the outcome of an operation to another dataset. A loading operation in this sense
  differs from a normal manipulation because first a copy of the original dataset is created
  and then the operation is applied. Also this type of generation can take in consideration
  multiple datasets, for example during a join operation.

Following the references to the ``local`` loaders:

        How to load a local ``csv`` file

Following the references to the ``remote`` loaders:

:doc:`darf.src.data_loader.load_remote`
        How to load a remote file on the local system through ``ssh``

The methods that manipulates a dataset to create a new one
are listed below:
