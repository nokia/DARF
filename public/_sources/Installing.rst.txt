Installation
============

Currentyl this package is not available on pip.
Please refer to the source installation instructions below.

Install from source
-------------------

First, clone the repository, the main branch contains the latest stable version of the code.

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/Nokia/DARF

If you don't have git available consider downloading the code as a zip file from the repository
following darf_link_ to obtain the zip file.

.. _darf_link: https://github.com/nokia/DARF/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Once downloaded enter into the `DARF` directory.

Use the convenience `Makefile` to create a virtualenvironment.

.. code:: bash

   cd DARF
   make virtualenv

This script is going to instal the correct version of python and load all the required
libraries to run `DARF`.
The presence of `virtualenv` is required to run the script.

Once the virtual environment is created, you can activate it with:

.. code:: bash

   source env/bin/activate

To deactivate the virtual environment, you can use:

.. code:: bash

   deactivate

You can now install `DARF` using the following command from the main directory:

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m pip install -e .

This will install `DARF` in editable mode, allowing you to make changes to the code and have
them reflected immediately without needing to reinstall.
This should be the goto option for developing components directly into the `DARF` ecosystem.

If you want to install `DARF` in a non-editable mode, you can use the following command:

.. code:: bash

   python3 -m pip install .

To check if `DARF` is installed correctly, you can run the following command:

.. code:: bash

   darf --help
