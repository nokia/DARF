Load Local
==========

This module is used to load a locally available dataset.
The dataset is loaded expecting a ``.csv`` file provided as a path.

This module is used when the ``origin=Local`` keyword is used in the configuration file.

An example of configuration file that loads a local available csv file is the following
configuration:

.. code-block:: ini

    [test_dataset]
    type=dataset
    origin=Local
    value=<path to a local csv file>

The correct loading of the dataset can be tested using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    darf -c conf.ini -D test_dataset
