Operations obj Module
=====================

This module contains the operations object.
This object can be used to create operations dictionaries on the fly.

class Operations():

    def __init__(self, operations: Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]):
        """__init__.

        function to generate the operations object.
        It takes as input a Dictionary of operations, where each key
        identify a different operation.
        Each operation is identified by it's name.
        The attributes in the dictionary describes how the operation
        is going to be applied.
        There is one mandatory field that should be in the operation
        object:
            - operation: the function to call
        The optional fieds int he dictionary are:
            - args: the arguments to pass to the function
            - kwargs: the keyword arguments to pass to the function
        If those arguments are not present then a default empty Tuple and Dict
        will be used respectively.

        Types accepted:
            - Operation key: must be a string
            - Operation function: must be a function
            - Operation args: must be a Tuple
            - Operation kwargs: must be a Dict
        If different types are provided an exception will be raised.

        All other keys in the operation dictionary will be discarded.

        Parameters
        ----------
        operations : Dict[str, Dict[str, Any]]
            The dictionary of operations, the first level key identifies
            the operation, the second level keys are the attributes of the
            operation.

        ------
